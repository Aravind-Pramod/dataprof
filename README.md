Data Quality Monitoring with Polars
Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust and efficient Data Quality (DQ) monitoring and alerting system leveraging the high-performance capabilities of the Polars data manipulation library. The primary goal is to ensure the integrity and reliability of data by automatically detecting common quality issues (e.g., missing values, inconsistencies, invalid formats) and triggering alerts when predefined thresholds are breached.
